# PlexPrivacy

Given the recent questionable actions by Plex; banning an entire hosting provider (Hetzner), banning servers with too many users, sending emails to users with huge privacy concerns. 

Plex maintains that it does not log content being viewed or streamed from a server, but it would appear they are getting this information from client devices. 

This is a block list of domains used by plex clients which can be blocked by AdGuard Home.
